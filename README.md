### Planeter - Mini Ksp

![Planets - From CGP Grey Video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37050834/87459874-418eb480-c60c-11ea-8d90-1eafdd52e7d2.png)

The project aims to create an orbit based puzzle game on mobile devices with high influence from the desktop game Kerbal
Space Programm. For the static orbit prediction of planets Keplerian elements
and their laws of planetary motion are used. The dynamic predictions for the
user-controlled spaceship use a performance adapted gravity system approach
and simple Newtonian calculations.

To reduce the risk of feature creeping three design pillars have been defined that
need to be addressed and may not be contradicted by additional features or
content. These **design pillars** are: 
1. ### **minimalism**
2. ### **education** 
3. ### **gratification**. 
Users are able to download the latest prototypes/builds from [Google Drive](
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-CI-kAiKsY4FEDwQmcAWbDM9oTFoPtvh). and
sessions in which the user is observed while using the prototype are done.
